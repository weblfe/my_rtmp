//! A flexible and easy-to-use logger that writes logs to stderr and/or to files
//! or other output streams.
//!
//! To read the log specification from an environment variable and get the log written to `stderr`,
//! start `flexi_logger` e.g. like this:
//! ```rust
//! flexi_logger::Logger::try_with_env().unwrap().start().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! See
//!
//! * The builder [`Logger`] for a full description of all configuration options,
//! * module [`code_examples`] for various concrete examples of `flexi_logger` initialization
//! * the module [`writers`] for the usage of additional log writers,
//! * and [the README](https://crates.io/crates/flexi_logger) for how to get started.
//!
//! There are configuration options to e.g.
//!
//! * decide whether you want to write your logs to stderr or to a file,
//! * configure the path and the filenames of the log files,
//! * use file rotation,
//! * specify the line format for the log lines,
//! * apply a stateful filter before log lines are really written,
//! * define additional log output streams, e.g for alert or security messages,
//! * support changing the log specification while the program is running,
//!
//! `flexi_logger` uses a similar syntax as [`env_logger`](http://crates.io/crates/env_logger/)
//! for specifying which logs should really be written (but is more graceful with the syntax,
//! and can provide error information).
//!
//! By default, i.e. if feature `colors` is not switched off, the log lines that appear on your
//! terminal are coloured. In case the chosen colors don't fit to your terminal's color theme,
//! you can adapt the colors to improve readability.
//! See the documentation of method [`Logger::set_palette`]
//! for a description how this can be done.
